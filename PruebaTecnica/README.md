# Avatar Integration Samples

The Avatar Integration sample project contains sample scenes demonstrating the integration of Meta's [Avatars SDK](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/meta-avatars-overview/) with the [Meta XR Interaction SDK](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-isdk-interaction-sdk-overview/). These samples provide practical examples of creating custom hand poses and object interactions. The integration is handled by two new prefabs, **OculusInteractionAvatarSdkManager** and **Avatar**. You can find them in the **Assets/Prefabs** folder in Unity once you complete the **Getting started** section.
